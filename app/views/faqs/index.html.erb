<h4>Interview Tips</h4>
<br />
<div>
  1. Be sure to greet the interviewer, make eye contact, and offer to shake hands.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  2. Take your time. Calm down and breathe. Practice the RIOT technique:
  <br />
  <br />
  R = REPEAT the challenge
  <br />
  I = clarify INPUTs
  <br />
  O = clarify OUTPUTs
  <br />
  T = consider TESTs (edge cases)
  <br />
</div>
<br />
<div>
  3. Be vocal. Talk about your thought process. As you are solving the problem on the whiteboard, pretend you are a teacher and you are explaining what you are doing. Show the interviewers your commuications skills and your ability to frame and break down a problem. Talk about pros/cons of different solutions.
</div>
<br>
<div>
  4. Ask questions. Clarify requirements, and ask about edge cases. It is okay to ask for help getting started. Use the interviewer as a resource. Constraints may be vague on purpose! Use questions to show your knowledge in areas outside of the problem scope (i.e. testing, performance). Find a way to highlight your strengths.

  5. If you are asked a question that stumps you, it is okay to say, "To be honest, I don't know, but I'm willing to work with you and try. I am more than happy to take a crack at it". Show your enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

  6. Pseudo code before diving into actual code.
</div>
<br />
<div>
  7. Write neatly on the whiteboard. Start at the top left corner so you have room for more. Leave some spaces between your lines of code so that you can insert additional code later.

<h4>Giving Feedback</h4>

<br />
What is ASK feedback?
<div>
  A = actionable (give feedback that the candidate can use to take actionable steps to improve)
</div>
<div>
  S = specific (be as specific as possible about what the candidate did well or needs improvement on)
</div>
<div>
  K = kind (be encouraging and not mean; give positive feedback with negative feedback)
</div>
<br />
<h5>Example of ASK feedback (good):</h5>
"Nice, neat printing on the whiteboard."
<br />
"Good job vocalizing your thought process."
<br />
"It would be helpful if you could make more eye contact with the interviewer."
<br />
"Consider writing the expected input/output on the left or right side of the whiteboard."
<h5>Example of non-ASK feedback (not the best):</h5>
"You did well." (not specific)
<br />
"Your coding skills are terrible; you are not very smart" (not kind)
<br />
"You should be taller." (not actionable)
<br />
